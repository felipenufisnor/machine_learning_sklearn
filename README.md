Machine Learning: Classification with SKLearn

In this project, I applied machine learning in a company;
I practiced with several examples;
I saw how classification algorithms are everywhere in our daily lives;
I analyzed results with the eyes of a data scientist;
I compared the result of linear and non-linear algorithms;
I understood behind the scenes what machine learning is all about for classification;
I made replicable studies, with testing strategies;
Finally, I used Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Dummy Classifiers.
